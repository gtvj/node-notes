# Native implementation of Websocket server

To run this simply: 

* Start the server with `node ws`
* Open the `index.html` file in Chrome (you can run this via `php -S localhost:9999` or even open it from Finder)

Having done this you can open the relevant port from a couple of browsers and have them communicate with each other.
